Recap of 2016 Study: 

    O.Y. were an estimated 13% of the total youth population, i.e. people between the ages of 16 and 24 who are neither in school nor working (~19K of ~140K).

    Why OY Matter: 
        Social and economic costs for O.Y., the government and society at large
        Talent pipeline solution for existing shortfall of candidates for local jobs

    Data compiled by The Community Center for Education Results (CCER)

Methodology:

    Identify O.Y. from PUMS 2013-2017 dataset published by the ACSO:
    
        Age
        Sex
        Employment Status
        Race
        Educational Attainment
        PUMA Region (limited to South King County)

    Identify South King County from MAF/TIGER DB published by the US Census Bureau: 
        Use shapefiles to plot all counties in Washington; isolate King County; highlight South King County, defined by PUMA regions (11610-11615)

    Assess trend between most recently available data (2017) and from original report (2014)

FIndings from comparing 2016 reports and current analysis:

    * Total sample size has dropped by 39%

    * The proportion of O.Y. to total youth population has slightly decreased

    * In the long run, the goal is for both O.Y. and youth working without diplomas to both decrease 

    * There are now proportionally fewer college-educated O.Y. across all age brackets
    
    * In terms of race: a). as a share of all American Indian/Alaska Native youth, higher percentage are now classified as OY. b). As a share of all OY, Hispanic youth are now a higher percentage. 

    
    
Recommendations:
    
    * Assess ROI of existing support programs and derive recommendations for greater efficiency

    * Highlight some individual success stories to the local business community to drive better hiring

    * Focus more on OY segments showing least improvement

Next steps: 

    * Data Freshness & Richness
    * Precisely duplicate sample set of 2016 report
    * Use PUMA Survey from 2014-2018
    * Include all intervening years in trend analysis
    * Additional EDA
    * Choropleth of O.Y. data by PUMA 
    * Available jobs for < 29 in South King County by PUMA:
    * Most popular industries for employment
    * Industries with the greatest shortage of workers
    * Expanded Scope
    * Track O.Y. pipeline over time
